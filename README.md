# Project to implement dropdown with search through a list of checkboxes in Angular

Implementation of this gave me a lot of trouble at work on many prjects as there used be a bug where when you search and check on one of the checkboxes, the checkbox of some other item might be checked once the search term is removed.

An implementation using FormArray and FormGroup is available in the branch `using-form-array-and-form-group`

This is an angular project.
